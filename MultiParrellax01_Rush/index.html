                    <!-- <span>IN THE BEGINNING…</span> -->
                    IN THE BEGINNING…  Lush was founded in 1995 by six co-founders; Mo Constantine, Mark Constantine, Rowena Bird, Helen Ambrosen, Liz Bennett and Paul Greeves.
                    Emerging from the demise of a previous mail order business called Cosmetics To Go – a massive success that collapsed through a combination of over-trading and flooding – it was the same team that created and inspired this new venture called Lush.
                    Lush is 10% Employee Owned and our people are the heart and soul of our business…

                        in making effective products from fresh, organic* fruit and vegetables, the finest essential oils and safe synthetics.
                        We believe in buying ingredients only from companies that do not commission tests on animals and in testing our products on humans.
                        We believe in happy people making happy soap, putting our faces on our products and making our mums proud.
                        We believe in long candlelit baths, sharing showers, massage, filling the world with perfume and in the right to make mistakes, lose everything and start again.
                        We believe that all people should enjoy freedom of movement across the world.
                        We believe our products are good value, that we should make a profit and that the customer is always right.

                        So much has happened since Charity Pot was launched in 2007. Our giving has become more diverse and has evolved to support amazing initiatives as they try to respond to the ever increasing complexities of human impact in the world. It is through our giving and campaigning that we can resource and give platform to those likeminded partners doing work on the ground to move the dial on the issues we care about as a business.

                        Together with the climate emergency, biodiversity loss is one of the big pressing issues of our times. The evolution of life moves towards more diversity and complexity. We know, for example, that increasing plant species diversity contributes to increased ecosystem services. How can we, as humanity and as a business, contribute to ensure our biodiversity keeps flourishing?
